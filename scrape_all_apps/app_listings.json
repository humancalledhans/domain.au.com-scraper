Test it, see browser &amp; server events arrived, deduplicated in real-time.</p></li>\n<li><p>No-code: page view, view content, add to cart, initiate checkout, purchase are auto set up</p></li>\n<li><p>Send what\\'s needed: events come with content_id, content_type, URL, microdata (optional), conversion value (with or without shipping fee), fbp, fbc, email &amp; phone (securely hashed) for advanced matching.</p></li>\n<li><p>Auto-synced Catalogs: submit products to Facebook in a breeze. With all the product info (title, price, availability, ids &amp; more), you\\'ll be able to view how each product is getting attention (events) or getting abandoned. From there, you\\'ll run Dynamic Product Ads (retargeting) accordingly.</p></li>\n<li><p>Button/Link click custom events: think form submit, demo click, etc. Track &amp; send what\\'s valuable for your business beyond the conventional standard events.\n--&gt; No need to pay huge bucks for a cloud server to use Google Tag Manager server container.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Ensure the data integrity before you scale ads based on it.</h4>\n<p>It\\'s uneasy living in fear your pixels are down at times. That\\'s why we launched in-app analytics and dashboard. You will see which pixels (with CAPI enabled) send what events, how many, what orders (purchases), in what date range. </p>\n<h4>Have a test strategy that evolves with this ever more competitive landscape</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Have some niche pixels to separate the data. Having only 1 pixel per general store won\\'t be optimal, as you\\'re mixing up all the events while the audience behind each bears little resemblance. </p></li>\n<li><p>Have a backup pixel: even when the primary got down, you won\\'t be crying for the loss of well-trained data if you\\'ve set up a backup from the outset.</p></li>\n<li><p>Want to install one same pixel to multiple international stores? That\\'s a-okay. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We take pride in accurate tracking for thousands of users &amp; are right on the other end to help you achieve that.
